# Optimization on Tilt Series Alignment
Research on microscopy image processing and deep learning + bioinformatics

# 1. Paper: [1995]A marker-free alignment method for electron tomography
File 1 : CommonLine.h - An implementation for this paper which contains an important algorithm for coarse alignment <br>
File 2 : commonline.cpp - test file

File 1 and File 2 can be imported using visual studio 2015. All the paths are absolute directories. 
You can create a C++ project in visual studio 2015 and import CommonLine.h as header file , then commonline.cpp  as a source file.<br>
CommonLine.h is still under editing now, if anyone has suggestions or questions we can discuss in Issues on this page. <br>Thank you !<br>
<b>Dependencies : fftw3, opencv 2.4.13</b>
