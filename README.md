# Optimization on Tilt Series Alignment
Research on microscopy image processing and deep learning + bioinformatics

# 1. Paper: [1995]A marker-free alignment method for electron tomography
file 1 : CommonLine.h - An implementation for this paper which contains an important algorithm for coarse alignment
file 2 : commonline.cpp - test file

File 1 and file 2 can be imported using visual studio 2015. All the paths are absolute directory. 
You can create a C++ project in visual studio 2015 and import CommonLine.h as header file , then commonline.cpp  as a source file.

Dependencies : fftw3, opencv 2.4.13
